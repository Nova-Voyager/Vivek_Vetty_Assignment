# Vivek_Vetty_Assignment
In this assignment, I created the two tables from the snapshot transactions and items and filled them with the exact sample rows like buyer 3 buying item a1, or buyer 12 getting a refund on item b2. After the tables were ready, I wrote SQL queries to answer all eight questions. For example, I counted how many non-refunded purchases happened each month, checked which stores got at least 5 orders in October 2020, and calculated how many minutes it took for a refund, like the refund that happened for buyer 12. I also found each store’s very first order, checked which item people bought first most often, created a TRUE/FALSE flag for refunds done within 72 hours, and identified second purchases for each buyer (if they had more than one non-refunded order). I added simple comments so the logic is easy for anyone to understand.
